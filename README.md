# Who-Dis

DISCLAIMER: This tool should be used in the white hat way, however, I have no responsibility if someone will use for malicious purposes.

A command line tool implemented in Python that has as main goal to give me the feel of security tools found in security OS distributions such as Kali Linux.  This tool collects and stores Open Source Intelligence (aka OSINT) about a target domain or individual.

I am planning to include:
1) advanced google dorks and search to target social media such as Facebook, Linkedin, Twitter.
2) Use social media information (having as target the email) to search if user has been pawned and if yes, search more in depth for details specifically password.
3) Pipl website search searching for more accounts related to the user.
4) Construction of path of journey and statistics if twitter found.
5) Usage of the website inteltechniques to identify the interests of the target, mainly to use spear phishing against.
