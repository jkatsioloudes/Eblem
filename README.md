## Motivation
Implemented in my free time from mid August to mid September 2017 as part of my genuine interest in Cyber Security, especially penetration testing.  After I played around with some Kali Linux tools, I have identified a gap in performing high quality OSINT search wholly from the command line and by a few clicks to get a browser with many tabs containing useful information.  

My short term aim is to make the life of a pentester easier by providing, constantly improving and maintaining an optimised and effective toolset with various powerful features.  My main long term goal is to contribute to the cybersecurity progress that has yet to come in both software and hardware systems.  A potential first step towards this direction is by offering an optimised OSINT solution by a possible combination or extension of a famous and must have existing OSINT tool with features from Eblem and also I aspire of writing or contributing into another tool that effeciently performs classification for cyber security related problems by deploying state-of-the-art Machine Learning.
